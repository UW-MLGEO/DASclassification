## Goal
In this project we plan to classify different signals in DAS data.

## Data:
OOI 2021
Whidbey 2024

## Metadata File
The Metadata file for this project helps give bounds in time and space to ships identified for ML.

Columns:
Ship_# - Unique # given to each different ship
folder_name - name of folder
Gauge_length - Determines spatial resolution of data
Interrogator - Instrument used
depth - depth of cable (m)
Ship_type - type of ship
Ship_speed - speef of ship
Cable - Which OOI cable is being utilized (North or South)
Lon	- Longitude (degrees)
Lat	- Latitude (degress)
~Start_distance - (closest distance along cable from Pacific City, OR [km] where ship is seen)
~End_distance - (furthest distance along cable from Pacific City, OR [km] where ship is seen)
~Start_channel - (closest channel along cabe from Pacific City, OR [km] where ship is seen, converted from distance)
~End_channel - (furthest channel along cabe from Pacific City, OR [km] where ship is seen, converted from distance)
~Start_Time - (First time ship is seen)
~End_Time -	(last time ship is seen)
